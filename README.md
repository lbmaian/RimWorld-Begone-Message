# Begone, Message!
You know those messages on food rotting and relations decaying and so forth that annoyingly block some of the colonist bar at the top?

This mod allows you to (by default):
* Dismiss a message by right-clicking that message.
* Dismiss all messages by shift-right-clicking any message.

Whether (shift)-right-clicking a message dismisses only that message or dismisses all messages can be customized in the mod options.

## Compatibility
Should be safe to add and remove from existing save games.

Should be compatible with other mods.
